I hold a PhD on AI ethics where I lead applied researches since 2019. Across Paris, Oxford and Stanford, I have been working closely with data-scientists and AI project teams to integrate ethical processes in finance (credit and wealth management), hiring, and education.

I enjoy helping computer scientists integrate the ethical stakes behind their code, while also equipping non-specialists with practical guidance on sovereignty and transparency in Large Language Models. At European level, I contribute as an expert on the EU AI Act.

Outside work, I am deeply drawn to the arts — especially poetry and Cuban salsa — and I recharge in the mountains through ultra-trail running.
